OpenShock, formerly ShockLink, is a opensource platform to control various shocking devices via the internet and much more.

![Web Interface](https://openshock.org/images/webui/shockers.webp)

We currently mainly focus on controlling premade shockers via esp32 using 433 MHz RF.

## Features already implemented:
+ Realtime control of multiple shocker types
+ Advanced realtime control / modulating intensity as its going
+ Account management
+ Share shockers permanently with friends
+ Shareable links
+ API for applications to integrate into the platform
+ ShockOsc for shocking control via OSC
+ Web control via the web panel

## WIP:
+ Local server (on the ESP directly)
+ New Frontend
+ Dashboard to group shockers together and have greater control
